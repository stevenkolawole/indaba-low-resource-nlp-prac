        "\n",
        "1. **Data Scarcity:**\n",
        "   - **Limited Training Data:** Many languages lack large annotated corpora necessary for training NLP models.\n",

        "   - **Morphological Complexity:** Some languages have complex grammatical structures and morphological richness.\n",

        "\n",
        "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference (or ground truth) summaries. ROUGE is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly for evaluating the performance of text summarization models.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key ROUGE Variants\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **ROUGE-N**: Measures the overlap of n-grams between the candidate summary and the reference summary.\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams (1-gram).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams (2-grams).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate and reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate summary and the reference summary. Unlike ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L considers sentence-level structure similarity by identifying the longest co-occurring sequence of words in both summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ROUGE-W**: A weighted version of ROUGE-L that gives more importance to the contiguous LCS.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ROUGE-S**: Measures the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are pairs of words in their order of appearance that can have any number of gaps between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How ROUGE is Computed\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE metrics can be calculated in terms of three measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recall**: The ratio of overlapping units (n-grams, LCS, or skip-bigrams) between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the reference summary. It answers, \"How much of the reference summary is captured by the candidate summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Precision**: The ratio of overlapping units between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the candidate summary. It answers, \"How much of the candidate summary is relevant to the reference summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. This gives a balanced measure that considers both precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of ROUGE\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE is essential for summarization tasks because it provides a standardized way to evaluate and compare different summarization models. Higher ROUGE scores generally indicate that the candidate summary is more similar to the reference summary, meaning the model is likely performing well.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, while ROUGE is widely used, it's not without its limitations. It primarily measures lexical overlap and may not fully capture the semantic meaning or quality of a summary. As such, it's often used in conjunction with human evaluations for a more comprehensive assessment of summary quality.\n",
