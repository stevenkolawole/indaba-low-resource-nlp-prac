        "**Introduction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-resource NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the study and development of NLP models and systems for languages, tasks, or domains that have limited data and resources available. These can include languages with fewer digital text corpora, limited computational tools, or less-developed linguistic research.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Challenges in Low-Resource NLP**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Scarcity:**\n",
        "   - **Limited Training Data:** Many languages lack large annotated corpora necessary for training NLP models.\n",
        "   - **Lack of Pre-trained Models:** Popular NLP models like BERT, GPT, and others are often not available for low-resource languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Linguistic Diversity:**\n",
        "   - **Morphological Complexity:** Some languages have complex grammatical structures and morphological richness.\n",
        "   - **Dialectal Variations:** A lack of standardized versions can complicate NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Resource Limitations:**\n",
        "   - **Computational Constraints:** Low-resource scenarios often involve limited access to computational power and storage.\n",
        "   - **Expertise and Tools:** Fewer linguistic experts and fewer NLP tools are tailored for these languages.\n",

        "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference (or ground truth) summaries. ROUGE is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly for evaluating the performance of text summarization models.\n",

        "   - **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams (1-gram).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams (2-grams).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate and reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate summary and the reference summary. Unlike ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L considers sentence-level structure similarity by identifying the longest co-occurring sequence of words in both summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ROUGE-W**: A weighted version of ROUGE-L that gives more importance to the contiguous LCS.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ROUGE-S**: Measures the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are pairs of words in their order of appearance that can have any number of gaps between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How ROUGE is Computed\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE metrics can be calculated in terms of three measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recall**: The ratio of overlapping units (n-grams, LCS, or skip-bigrams) between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the reference summary. It answers, \"How much of the reference summary is captured by the candidate summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Precision**: The ratio of overlapping units between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the candidate summary. It answers, \"How much of the candidate summary is relevant to the reference summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. This gives a balanced measure that considers both precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of ROUGE\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE is essential for summarization tasks because it provides a standardized way to evaluate and compare different summarization models. Higher ROUGE scores generally indicate that the candidate summary is more similar to the reference summary, meaning the model is likely performing well.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### NOTE: Caveat\n",
        "<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: space-between;\">\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "While ROUGE and other evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, METEOR, etc) serve as valuable tools for quick and straightforward evaluation of language models, they have certain limitations that render them less than ideal. To begin with, they fall short when it comes to assessing the fluency, coherence, and overall meaning of passages. They are also relatively insensitive to word order. ROUGE primarily measures lexical overlap and may not fully capture the semantic meaning or quality of a summary. For these reasons, researchers are still trying to find improved metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, these metrics are not shoe-in replacements for human evaluation, but are best used in conjunction with human evaluations for a more comprehensive assessment of summary quality."

In addition, many real-world use-cases require adapting avialable LLMs to their target task in order to achieve desired performance.\n",

A low intrinsic dimension means the data can be effectively represented or approximated by a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of its essential information or structure. In other words, this means we can decompose the new weight matrix for the adapted task into lower-dimensional (smaller) matrices without losing significant information.\n",

        "Concretely, let us suppose $\\delta W$ is the weight update for an $A\\times B$ weight matrix. Then, a low-rank decompsoition of $\\delta W$ can be expressed as: $\\delta W = W_A W_B$, where $W_A$ is an $A\\times k$ matrix and $W_B$ is a $k\\times B$ matrix. Here, $k$ is the rank of the decomposition, and is typically much smaller than $A$ and $B$.\n",
