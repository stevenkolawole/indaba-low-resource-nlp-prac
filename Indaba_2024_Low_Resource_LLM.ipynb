        "Low-resource NLP (Natural Language Processing) refers to the study and development of NLP models and systems for languages, tasks, or domains that have limited data and resources available.

        "ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries by comparing them to reference (or ground truth) summaries. ROUGE is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly for evaluating the performance of text summarization models.\n",

        "   - **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams (1-gram).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams (2-grams).\n",
        "   - **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate and reference summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate summary and the reference summary. Unlike ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L considers sentence-level structure similarity by identifying the longest co-occurring sequence of words in both summaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **ROUGE-W**: A weighted version of ROUGE-L that gives more importance to the contiguous LCS.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **ROUGE-S**: Measures the overlap of skip-bigrams, which are pairs of words in their order of appearance that can have any number of gaps between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How ROUGE is Computed\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE metrics can be calculated in terms of three measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Recall**: The ratio of overlapping units (n-grams, LCS, or skip-bigrams) between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the reference summary. It answers, \"How much of the reference summary is captured by the candidate summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Precision**: The ratio of overlapping units between the candidate summary and the reference summary to the total units in the candidate summary. It answers, \"How much of the candidate summary is relevant to the reference summary?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. This gives a balanced measure that considers both precision and recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of ROUGE\n",
        "\n",
        "ROUGE is essential for summarization tasks because it provides a standardized way to evaluate and compare different summarization models. Higher ROUGE scores generally indicate that the candidate summary is more similar to the reference summary, meaning the model is likely performing well.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "While ROUGE and other evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, METEOR, etc) serve as valuable tools for quick and straightforward evaluation of language models, they have certain limitations that render them less than ideal. To begin with, they fall short when it comes to assessing the fluency, coherence, and overall meaning of passages. They are also relatively insensitive to word order. ROUGE primarily measures lexical overlap and may not fully capture the semantic meaning or quality of a summary. For these reasons, researchers are still trying to find improved metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, these metrics are not shoe-in replacements for human evaluation, but are best used in conjunction with human evaluations for a more comprehensive assessment of summary quality."

        "The paper [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) takes inspiration from the conjecture that over-parameterized models span a low-rank intrinsic dimension. A low intrinsic dimension means the data can be effectively represented or approximated by a lower-dimensional space while retaining most of its essential information or structure. In other words, this means we can decompose the new weight matrix for the adapted task into lower-dimensional (smaller) matrices without losing significant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concretely, let us suppose $\\delta W$ is the weight update for an $A\\times B$ weight matrix. Then, a low-rank decompsoition of $\\delta W$ can be expressed as: $\\delta W = W_A W_B$, where $W_A$ is an $A\\times k$ matrix and $W_B$ is a $k\\times B$ matrix. Here, $k$ is the rank of the decomposition, and is typically much smaller than $A$ and $B$.\n",

In this case, we will use the [MT5](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small) model, which is a multilingual variant of the T5 model. The MT5 model is trained on a large multilingual corpus and is capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks, including summarization."
